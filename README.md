Create an event page on the "Seputar Kuliah Kita" website as a means for students to register to take part in competitions and disseminate information widely about events being held on campus or outside campus.

This website was created based on a project for the Interaction Design and User Interface course divided into several teams. In this project I got jobdecs to create student event menu content.
